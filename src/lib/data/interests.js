    title: `Piano`,
    year: '2025',
    description: `I recently started the piano after realizing it's way more friendly than the guitar (which I confidently gave up back in 2015). I still wonder 
    why I didn't start with the piano in the first place. I'm currently at A1 level, but even that is enough to help me slow down and relax after a long day.`

    year: '2022',
    description: `I traveled a lot within my home country, India, but moving to Europe completely changed my idea of travel. You can cross borders in a few hours 
    and suddenly be in a different country with a new language, culture, and food. I've visited several European countries and enjoy learning about local customs 
    and cuisines - including Spain, the Czech Republic, Croatia, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Italy, Hungary, Ireland, Luxembourg, and a few more along the way.`

    title: `Outdoor Games`,
    year: '2021',
    description: `After moving to Germany, playing outdoors - especially in summer - became one of my favorite ways to unwind. I enjoy soccer, beach volleyball, 
    badminton, table tennis, hiking, squash, and pickleball. It's basically my way of staying active, and conveniently doubles as a great way to socialize.`

    id: `photography`,
    title: `Photography`,
    year: '2018',
    description: `I developed an interest in photography in 2018 and enjoy capturing moments and landscapes. For a long time, I just collected photos in my gallery 
    until I eventually thought, “Why not give them a home?” So I created a photography section on the homepage and am currently working on a dedicated Instagram page 
    for it. It's still under construction, but coming soon.`

    id: `crypto`,
    title: `Cryptocurrency and Blockchain`,
    year: '2017',
    description: `I've been into blockchain since 2017. During my internship, I built a project that used in-browser mining (Monero) as a way to protect privacy. 
    Instead of tracking users with annoying cookies, they could just choose to mine a little bit of crypto to support the site. Consent first, always.`

    id: `cybersecurity`,
    title: `Cybersecurity`,
    year: '2015',
    description: `I'm a developer, but my soul is still in security. I started with ethical hacking back in college and never really stopped. I still enjoy keeping 
    up with security trends, finding bugs or helping people patch their sites. Sometimes I do a little 'unauthorized' help but always with good intentions, of course.`

    id: `coffee`,
    title: `Trying Different Coffee Blends`,
    year: '2012',
    description: `I'm a coffee enthusiast and enjoy trying blends from around the world. It started during school exam nights fueled by late-night study sessions - long 
    before I realized it would turn into a hobby. These days my kitchen cabinet is packed with coffee from Spain, Mexico, Italy, Germany, India, and beyond.`

    id: `chess`,
    title: `Chess`,
    year: '2008',
    description: `I've been playing chess since around 2008 and even participated in a few local tournaments (yes, I won some). I'm not a professional - currently hovering 
    around a 800 rating - but I enjoy playing in my free time, whether online or casually in cafés. In Berlin, this often meant a game of chess paired with a drink and 
    good conversation.`
